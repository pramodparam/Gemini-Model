**1. Mercury**
* While it's the smallest planet in our solar system, it has the second-largest iron core, giving it a higher density than any other planet.

**2. Venus**
* Known as Earth's "twin" due to its similar size and composition, Venus has a thick, carbon dioxide atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet in the solar system.

**3. Earth**
* The only known planet in the universe to support life, Earth has a unique combination of liquid water, a breathable atmosphere, and plate tectonics that have shaped its surface and environment.

**4. Mars**
* Often called the "Red Planet" due to its iron oxide-rich surface, Mars had a thicker atmosphere and liquid water in the past, suggesting the possibility of past or present life.

**5. Saturn**
* Known for its iconic ring system made of ice particles and dust, Saturn's rings span over 282,000 kilometers in diameter and are visible from Earth with even small telescopes.
